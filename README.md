Reinforcement Learning for Stock Trading Using Q-Learning on NTPC Stock Data
This project applies Reinforcement Learning (RL) to the stock market, using a Q-learning algorithm to develop a trading agent for NTPC stock. The agent learns to make optimal buy, sell, or hold decisions based on historical data, with the goal of maximizing cumulative returns. This project demonstrates how RL can be applied to finance, leveraging a data-driven approach to create an adaptive trading strategy.
Project Overview
This project implements a basic reinforcement learning model for trading stocks using Q-learning. Q-learning, a model-free RL algorithm, helps the agent learn an optimal policy that defines the best action (buy, sell, hold) based on state-action pairs, iteratively improving to maximize rewards over time.

Key Concepts:

State: Current market conditions represented by stock price data and indicators.
Actions: Buy, Sell, or Hold.
Reward: Defined based on trading profits or losses after each action.
This model serves as a foundational approach for RL-based trading and can be expanded with more advanced techniques or integrated with other stock indicators to improve decision-making.

Algorithm
Q-Learning
Q-Learning is a reinforcement learning algorithm where the agent seeks to learn a policy to maximize rewards. It does so by learning Q-values for each state-action pair and updating them with experience. Key parameters include:


Results
The Q-learning agent achieved promising returns when compared to a buy-and-hold baseline. By training over multiple episodes, the agent improved its decision-making process, learning when to enter and exit trades for higher profitability.

Performance Metrics:

Cumulative Returns: Improved over baseline strategy.
Decision Accuracy: Enhanced trading accuracy with increasing episodes.
Exploration/Exploitation: The epsilon-greedy strategy provided a good balance of learning and leveraging profitable actions.
Future Work
This project has laid the groundwork for an RL-based stock trading model, and several enhancements can improve its performance:

Deep Q-Learning (DQN): Replace Q-learning with DQN to handle a larger state space and more complex market conditions.
Additional Indicators: Incorporate other technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD) to provide a more comprehensive view of market trends.
Hyperparameter Optimization: Experiment with different values for the learning rate, discount factor, and epsilon decay for potentially better performance.
Market Simulation: Create a more realistic trading simulation to better represent transaction costs, slippage, and other trading conditions.
